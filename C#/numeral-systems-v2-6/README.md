# Numeral Systems (v2)

## Task description

- Implement a [ParsePositiveFromOctal](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L21) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the octal numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent.
- Implement a [ParsePositiveFromDecimal](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L34) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the decimal numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent.
- Implement a [ParsePositiveFromHex](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L47) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the hex numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent.
- Implement a [ParsePositiveByRadix](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L34) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the octal, decimal or hex numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent.
- Implement a [ParseByRadix](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L47) extention method that converts the string representation of a signed number in the octal, decimal or hex numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent.
- Implement a [TryParsePositiveFromOctal](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L84) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the octal numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded.
- Implement a [TryParsePositiveFromDecimal](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L94) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the decimal numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded.
- Implement a [TryParsePositiveFromHex](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L104) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the hex numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded.
- Implement a [TryParsePositiveByRadix](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L116) extention method that converts the string representation of a positive number in the octal, decimal or hex numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded.
- Implement a [TryParseByRadix](NumeralSystems/Converter.cs#L128) extention method that converts the string representation of a signed number in the octal, decimal or hex numeral system to its 32-bit signed integer equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded.
