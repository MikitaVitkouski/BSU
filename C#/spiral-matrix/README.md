# Spiral Matrix

## Task description

Implement an [GetMatrix](SpiralMatrix/MatrixExtension.cs#L27) method for filling a square matrix of order `size` with spiral elements. The matrix must be filled with natural numbers from `1` to `size` in increments of `1`, starting from the upper left corner and twisting its elements in a clockwise spiral direction, as shown in the following example:

        Spiral matrix - size = 3

         1 2 3  
         8 9 4  
         7 6 5  

       Spiral matrix - size = 4
   
         1  2  3  4   
         12 13 14 5  
         11 16 15 6  
         10 9  8  7 

      ...
