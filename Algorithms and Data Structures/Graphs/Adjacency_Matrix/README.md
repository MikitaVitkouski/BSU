Given an undirected graph represented by a list of edges, construct the adjacency matrix of this graph. It is guaranteed that the graph has no loops or multiple edges.

Input (input.txt): The first line contains two integers, n and m, representing the number of vertices (1≤n≤100) and the number of edges in the graph (0≤m≤n(n−1)/2). The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. The next m lines describe the edges: each line contains two vertices u and v (1≤u,v≤n, and u and v are distinct) connected by an edge.

Output (output.txt): Print the adjacency matrix of the graph: n lines with n numbers each, where each number is either 0 or 1, and the numbers in each line are separated by spaces.
