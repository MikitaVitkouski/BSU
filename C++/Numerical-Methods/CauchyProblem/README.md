# Numerical Solution of the Cauchy Problem

This project implements numerical methods for solving the Cauchy problem ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d4ab074-ba23-468e-a16a-7687d4d460d9)
using:

- Explicit Euler Method (1st order) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/165d4d19-51aa-46b6-867f-7da86d748220)

- Explicit Rungeâ€“Kutta Method (2nd order, with \( \beta = 1 \))![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66e558da-36a4-4c0d-9703-5a00e1e200d3)

- Implicit Adams Method (Trapezoidal Rule, using Newton's method for nonlinearity) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d240c778-b2bc-4281-9133-f3ac9c103361)
