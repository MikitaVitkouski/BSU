1. **Boost.Thread for Multithreading:**
   - Utilized `boost::thread` for managing threads, simplifying thread creation and synchronization.

2. **Portable Thread Sleep:**
   - Replaced platform-specific `Sleep` with `boost::this_thread::sleep` for portable thread sleeping.

3. **Passing Parameters to Threads:**
   - Enhanced thread function parameter passing using `boost::ref` to avoid unnecessary data copying.

4. **Improved Code Readability:**
   - Boost abstractions improved code readability and maintainability.

6. **Better Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Boost provides a cross-platform solution, ensuring compatibility across different systems.
