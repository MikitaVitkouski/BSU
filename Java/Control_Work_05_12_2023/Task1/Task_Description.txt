Write a Base Converter class to convert from degrees Celsius to Kelvins , Fahrenheit , etc. The class must have a convert method, which does the conversion.
It is also necessary to implement a factory method with basic locale support, for example:
Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
String[] fahrenheit Countries = {"BS", "US", "BZ", "KY", "PW"};
