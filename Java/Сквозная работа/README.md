Task Description:

Implement a console application that performs the following operations:
1) Reads data from an input file.
2) Processes the received information.
3) Writes data to an output file.

Input and output files can be in various formats: plain text, XML, JSON. Additionally, the input and output files can be archived and encrypted using different engines (archive only, encryption only, first archived and then encrypted, and vice versa).

The "type" of the input and output files is specified by command-line parameters.

On the first stage of processing, find all arithmetic operations in the input file and replace them with the results in the output file.
