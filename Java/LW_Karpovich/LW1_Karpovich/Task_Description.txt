We perform two variants of the task:
A) Using standard JAVA instructions
B) Using the BigDecimal BigInteger class
The function is represented as its Taylor series. Calculate the approximate value of the sum of this infinite series. The calculations should be completed when the next term turns out to be modulo less than the specified number ε. The form of this number is determined by the following condition: ε = 10-k, where k is a natural number. Compare the result with the value calculated using standard functions.Enter the values of x and k using the keyboard.

I need to complete the task with the function e^x (exponent).
