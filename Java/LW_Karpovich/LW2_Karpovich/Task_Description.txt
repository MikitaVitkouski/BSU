Write a Java console application for working with matrix. Enter the size of the mxn matrix using the keyboard. Fill the matrix with random elements from 1 to 100. For processing, use the classes Random, Array, Vector, Arraylist.

1) Swap the row containing the element with the highest value in the matrix with the row containing the element with the lowest value. Display the resulting matrix on the screen. For each row with a zero element on the main diagonal, print its number and the value of the largest of the elements of this row.

2) For a given matrix nxn, find the maximum among the sums of elements of diagonals parallel to the main diagonal of the matrix.

3) Arrange the rows of the mxn matrix by non-decreasing (increasing) their largest elements.
