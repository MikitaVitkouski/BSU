Find the largest half-path in which the sum of the keys of the extreme vertices is minimal. Delete (by right deletion) the root vertex of this half-path.

Input:

The input file contains a sequence of numbers â€” the keys of the vertices in the order they are added to the tree. It is guaranteed that there are at least two vertices in the tree.

27
35
46

Output:

The output file must contain a sequence of vertex keys obtained by a direct left-hand traversal of the resulting tree.
