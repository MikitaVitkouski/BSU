1. **Communication Mechanism:**
    - **Original:** Uses file I/O for inter-process data exchange.
    - **Boost:** Utilizes shared memory for inter-process communication.

2. **Usage of `shm` and `region`:**
    - **Original:** Does not use `shm` and `region` objects.
    - **Boost:** Utilizes `boost::interprocess::shared_memory_object` (`shm`) and `boost::interprocess::mapped_region` (`region`) for shared memory operations.

3. **Use of `memcpy`:**
    - **Original:** Employs `std::istream::read` and `reinterpret_cast` for reading data from the file.
    - **Boost:** Uses `std::memcpy` for copying data to and from shared memory.

4. **Loop Iteration Count:**
    - **Original:** Iterates over all employees in the file.
    - **Boost:** Since shared memory is used, it assumes only one employee for the sake of simplicity in the example.

5. **File Operations:**
    - **Original:** Uses `std::ifstream` and `std::ofstream` for file operations.
    - **Boost:** Works with shared memory, eliminating the need for explicit file operations.

6. **Error Handling:**
    - **Original:** Utilizes `std::cerr` for error messages.
    - **Boost:** Also uses `std::cerr`; however, in more complex scenarios involving shared memory, additional error-handling mechanisms may be necessary.

7. **Number of Employees:**
    - **Original:** Iteratively reads all employee records from the file.
    - **Boost:** For simplicity in the example, it is limited to one employee since shared memory is used.

8. **Shared Memory Handling:**
    - **Original:** Does not interact with shared memory mechanisms.
    - **Boost:** Interacts with shared memory mechanisms, including creating (`open_or_create`) a `shared_memory_object`, setting its size (`truncate`), and mapping (`mapped_region`) this memory.
