# Filter By Palindromic

## Task description

Implement a [FilterByPalindromic](FilterByPalindromic/ArrayExtension.cs#L21) method that takes an array of integers and filters it in such a way that the output will be a new array consisting only of elements that are [palindromes](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/palindromic-number.git). If there are no such elements return an empty array. **Do not use LINQ queries and delegates**.
