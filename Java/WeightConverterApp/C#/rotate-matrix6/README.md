# Rotate Matrix

## Task description

Given an image represented by an `n x n` matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes.
- Implement a [Rotate90DegreesСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#L14) extention mehods that rotates the image clockwise by `90°` (do it in place).
- Implement a [Rotate90DegreesCounterСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#L24) extention mehods that rotates the image counterclockwise by `90°` (do it in place).  
- Implement a [Rotate180DegreesСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#L34) extention mehods that rotates the image clockwise by `180°` (do it in place).  
- Implement a [Rotate180DegreesCounterСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#L44) extention mehods that rotates the image counterclockwise by `180°` (do it in place).  
- Implement a [Rotate270DegreesСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#L54) extention mehods that rotates the image clockwise by `270°` (do it in place).  
- Implement a [Rotate270DegreesCounterСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#64) extention mehods that rotates the image counterclockwise by `270°` (do it in place).  
- Implement a [Rotate360DegreesСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#L74) extention mehods that rotates the image clockwise by `360°` (do it in place).  
- Implement a [Rotate360DegreesCounterСlockwise](RotateMatrix/ArrayExtensions.cs#L84) extention mehods that rotates the image counterclockwise by `360°` (do it in place).    
The task definition is given in the XML-comments for the method.     
_Restriction: Do not reduce the tasks to the challenge of turning by `90°`. Use only the capabilities of the C# language._
